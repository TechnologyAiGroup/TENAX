This experiment contains some of the datasets used in the TENAX paper.

64_4_200k_0.01_42_XORAPUF.csv contains 200k data entries for a 64-4 XOR APUF generated by Python simulation. Each entry consists of a 65-bit parity vector feature and a 1-bit response. For details on the code generated by the Python simulation, see the TENAX_source-tf2 folder.

XOR_PUF_64_5_CRPs_transformed.csv contains data for a 64-5 XOR APUF captured by the FPGA. Each entry consists of a 65-bit parity vector feature and a 1-bit response.

LSPUF_64_5_CRP_proceed.csv contains data for a 64-5 LSPUF captured by the FPGA. Each entry consists of a 65-bit parity vector feature and a 1-bit response.
